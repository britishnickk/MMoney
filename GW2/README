Guild Wars 2 files

Note: I do not intend to include recipes that require account-bound items. The
	goal of this program is to find recipes where you can buy items then
	craft them for profit as many times as necessary, but crafting with 
	account-bound items means that once you run out of the item, you must
	stop crafting. It is also difficult to assign a value to an account-bound
	item.
